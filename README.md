# News-Recommendation-System-using-Reinforcement-Learning
1. Project Overview
The project features a real-time adaptive news recommendation system based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). The system leverages deep learning approaches to personalize the delivery of news based on a user’s click history. Whenever a user is presented with a selection of articles - which may represent a broad set of articles - the system is able to sample the selected articles using learned behaviour policies and the system’s policies could potentially adjust based on users’ interactive feedback (from the environment).

2. Real-World Data:
The project uses the Microsoft News Dataset (MIND -small) dataset generated by Microsoft Research. The dataset: Contains actual click histories from users, impressions for articles, articles with metadata, etc. Simulates an actual live news feed environment that similar platforms (e.g., Microsoft News). Gives assurance that the RL is trained and evaluated with data that mirrors actual user behavior.

4. Technical Details
Preprocessing: Extracted article titles, encoded titles using SentenceTransformer (MiniLM-L6-v2), built user embeddings using average of clicked news vectors, stored all the article vectors in news_embeddings.pkl

Gym Environment Set Up: 
State: concatenation of user embedding and 5 candidate article embeddings
Action: selecting 1 article out of 5
Reward: 1 if article clicked, 0 otherwise

Agents:
Deep Q-Network (DQN): Learns Q-values Q(s,a) value function approximation using neural network, 3-layer feedforward network, trained using experience replay and MSE loss

Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C): Separate policy (actor) function and value estimation (critic), can learn the advantage function to lower variance, maximum learning stability and efficiency.
